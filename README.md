## Command Keybinds Keybinds
It adds 10 possible keybinds, which can each be assigned to a command using an ingame gui. When the keybind is enabled enabled and pressed, the command assigned is then executed. 

## Unlock and lock command
You are able to lock and unlock entities and blocks using commands (/lock & /unlock)
Locked entities are invulnerable, item frames are fixed and armor stand have all slots disabled.
Locked blocks are, well, locked using a set key

## Hide and reveal command
Entities can also be hidden and again revealed (/hide & /reveal)
They are either given invisibility or their invisibility tag will be set to true in the case of armorstands and item frames.
