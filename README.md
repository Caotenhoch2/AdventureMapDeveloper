A simple mod created to help building (adventure) maps. 

It adds 10 possible keybinds, which can each be assigned to a command using an ingame gui. When the keybind is enabled enabled and pressed, the command assigned is then executed. 

It also adds a toggle, which enables the player to see invisible entities, aswell one which enables him to see otherwise invisible blocks like barriers, structure voids etc. These can either be toggled using an ingame gui or with the help of a keybind.

Markers (Singleplayer only) and Interaction Entities can also be seen when toggled on

With no option toggled on:
